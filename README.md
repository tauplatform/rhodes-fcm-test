## Building Rhodes App

### iOS build
Run the following commands:

`rake build:iphone:setup_xcode_project`

`rake device:iphone:production`

Open xCode and install the .ipa file to your iOS device. Run the app and it shows the device identifier. The device identifier is required for sending the push messages. It is a long string, so it will be better to copy it from the app’s logs. You can get access to the app’s logs if start the app via xCode.

### Android build
Run the following command:

`rake run:android:device`

Run the app and it shows the device identifier. The device identifier is required for sending the push messages. It is a long string, so it will be better to copy it from the app logs. You can get access to the app’s logs by the command:

`adb logcat -s APP`
